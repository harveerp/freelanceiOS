This is where I put all my freelancing files, if I have access to them. I'll slowly put the files here and list out how they function and what they are used for.


## Social Accounts View Controllers
  
  The function of these files is to streamline the login for all the major social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Google using OAuth2.0. This removes the dependancies on their SDKs and gives a little more power to the developers.
  
  
## Swipe Media View
  
  This is a fully customizable Media player which can play any kind of audio and video. It has the capability of minimizing so user can freely explore the application while the media is playing. Within the media player, it shows, title, description of the media, sharing options and player controls.
